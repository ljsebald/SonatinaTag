README for SonatinaTag

What is SonatinaTag?
--------------------
SonatinaTag is a music file tag reading framework written in Objective C,
targeted mainly at Mac OS X. Currently it supports reading tags from MP3 files
(both ID3v1 and ID3v2), M4A files (iTunes-style tags are the only ones currently
supported for M4A), and FLAC files (Vorbis comments and Picture metadata).

Why SonatinaTag?
----------------
I started writing SonatinaTag mostly because I couldn't find anything suitable
for reading music tags written either in C or Objective C. Basically, I was
writing a small music player program for Mac OS X called Sonatina, and needed
tag reading support. I was using TagLib, which is written in C++, but found that
it seemed like more than a little bit of a kludge to be using it in a program
written completely in Objective C (TagLib is a great library in and of itself,
and supports all manner of files that SonatinaTag doesn't yet, so if you're
looking for a more mature library for this kind of stuff, grab it from
http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib.html). Basically, SonatinaTag exists
only because I didn't like using C++ in the middle of my Objective C program, as
silly as that may seem.

Requirements
------------
SonatinaTag has no external dependencies other than things that are found in the
Foundation framework on Mac OS X. I suspect that it would build fine against
GNUstep's Foundation as well, but I can't guarantee it, as I haven't tried to do
so (please let me know if it you try!). Since SonatinaTag by default builds in
64-bit/32-bit Universal format on Mac OS X, it does require Mac OS X 10.5 or
higher. I suspect that with a little work (like disabling 64-bit support), it
would build just fine for Mac OS X 10.4 (and probably even 10.3).

That's All Folks
----------------
Well, that's the end of the README file, as boring as it is. There's really
nothing else I can think of to say here.
