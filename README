README for SonatinaTag

What is SonatinaTag?
--------------------
SonatinaTag is a music file tag reading framework written in Objective C,
targeted mainly at Mac OS X. Currently it supports reading tags from MP3 files
(both ID3v1 and ID3v2), M4A files (iTunes-style tags are the only ones currently
supported for M4A), and FLAC files (Vorbis comments and Picture metadata).

Why SonatinaTag?
----------------
I started writing SonatinaTag mostly because I couldn't find anything suitable
for reading music tags written either in C or Objective C. Basically, I was
writing a small music player program for Mac OS X called Sonatina, and needed
tag reading support. I was using TagLib, which is written in C++, but found that
it seemed like more than a little bit of a kludge to be using it in a program
written completely in Objective C (TagLib is a great library in and of itself,
and supports all manner of files that SonatinaTag doesn't yet, so if you're
looking for a more mature library for this kind of stuff, grab it from
http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib.html). Basically, SonatinaTag exists
only because I didn't like using C++ in the middle of my Objective C program, as
silly as that may seem.

Requirements
------------
SonatinaTag has very few external dependencies. If you are building for a non
Mac OS X target, you basically just need a relatively sane build environment
that has decent support for C99 and a relatively POSIX-like libc. If you have
CoreFoundation installed, you can optionally use that as well to get the
API that I use in Sonatina itself.

On Mac OS X, there really aren't any external dependencies other than what
should be installed with any version of Xcode. The Xcode project builds by
default as a 32-bit PPC/32-bit x86/64-bit x86 Universal binary. The Xcode
project is set for a deployment target of Mac OS X 10.5 or later, but it
probably would work with earlier versions of Mac OS X as well.

That's All Folks
----------------
Well, that's the end of the README file, as boring as it is. There's really
nothing else I can think of to say here.
